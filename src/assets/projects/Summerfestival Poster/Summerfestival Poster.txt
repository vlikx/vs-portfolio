Project: RAMPEN FESTIVAL – Event Branding

Concept & Visibility
- The Brief: Developed a high-impact promotional poster for the "RAMPEN Festival" in direct cooperation with Aalen University (Hochschule Aalen).
- The Goal: Maximize event awareness and student engagement through a vibrant, high-contrast visual identity.
- Target Audience: Strategically deployed across campus buildings and local hotspots to capture the attention of the student body.

Visual Execution
- Dynamic Composition: Blended bold, brutalist typography with playful vector illustrations (Beerpong, Grill) to instantly communicate the event’s atmosphere.
- Information Hierarchy: Prioritized scannability of key data—date, location (Campus Burren), and schedule—ensuring the message is clear at a glance.
- Aesthetic: Used a high-energy color palette (Purple, Yellow, Pink) to stand out against typical campus notice boards, maintaining a youthful and inviting "Summer Festival" vibe.

Impact & Skillset
- Local Synergy: Effectively translated the university's vibrant culture into a physical marketing asset.
- Full Production: Handled the entire workflow from initial layout in Illustrator to final print preparation for large-scale physical distribution.

Project: NO SENSE OF TIME

Concept & Vision
- Context: Custom streetwear design commissioned for the techno and club scene.
- The Idea: Capturing the psychological "flow state" on the dancefloor where time perception dissolves—"No Sense of Time".
- Aesthetic: Brutalist, high-contrast white-on-black graphics designed for impact under club lighting.

Visual Execution
- Front: Minimalist typography with a subtle "perceptual distortion" effect.
- Back: A cosmic silhouette Gazing into a starlit void, framed by a deconstructed Roman numeral clock and suspended pendulums to symbolize frozen time.
- Impact: A unique fusion of 3D-informed visualization and subcultural storytelling that prioritizes both artistic edge and client satisfaction.
